# Agent Beta Test Report

This report summarizes a test run of the orchestrator and active agents after task 207. At the time of testing only **SWA-CORE-01** is active. The proposed QA and Docs agents from task 207 are not yet implemented.

## Environment
- Python version: Python 3.12.10
- Task queue length: 129
- Active agents:
```
SWA-CORE-01
```

## Test Run
The orchestrator was executed using:
```bash
python -m ai_swa.orchestrator _run --config config.yaml -v
```
Partial log output:
```
{
    "body": "Orchestrator running",
    "severity_number": 9,
    "severity_text": "INFO",
    "attributes": {
...
            "service.name": "ai_swa"
        },
        "schema_url": ""
    }
}
```

The run produced frequent `AttributeError` messages originating from `self_auditor.py`.

## Pytest Results
```

168 passed, 6 skipped, 23 warnings in 40.36s
```

## Observations
- The orchestrator executed multiple tasks but failed during the self-auditor stage.
- The missing QA and Docs agents mean the system does not yet run security or documentation checks.

## Follow-up Issues
- Implement agents SWA-QA-01 and SWA-DOCS-01 as described in task 207.
- Investigate the `AttributeError` in `self_auditor.py`.

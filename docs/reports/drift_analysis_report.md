# Drift Analysis Report

## Drift Analysis
- **Stale Success Criteria** – The README states the project succeeds when the main branch contains exactly one commit. The repository now has hundreds of commits. This is unacknowledged drift.
- **Protocol Alignment** – Agents generally follow the Iterative Development Protocol, but some tasks remain pending for long periods.
- **Self‑Evolution Emphasis** – Architecture docs and code implement evolutionary components, aligning with the vision of self‑improvement.
- **Unclear Boundary on Node Integration** – Cross-language support exists, but orchestration details remain vague, hinting at scope creep.
- **Governance and Ethics** – Policy framework and Ethical Sentinel are present and match governance goals.
- **CI Security Additions** – Recent tasks add SCA, SAST, sandbox testing, and signing steps in CI.

## Decision Audit Ledger
1. **CI Pipeline Hardening** – Origin: Task 135 SEC-001. Adds automated vetting and signing steps.
2. **Vision Engine RL vs WSJF Comparison** – Origin: Task 139 and related research.
3. **Node-Based IO Service** – Origin: README and architecture docs. Provides gRPC interface.
4. **Ethical Sentinel Policy Framework** – Origin: Governance tasks. Enforces responsible AI behavior.
5. **Evolutionary Policy Optimizer** – Origin: Two-Speed Reflector architecture doc.

## Trajectory Assessment
1. **Converging on Robust Self-Evolution** – Integration of RL prioritization, plugin certification, and ethical policies leads to mature autonomous development.
2. **Orbiting in Feature Bloat** – Expansion into Rust, Node, and complex CI may cause bloat if not pruned.
3. **Diverging into Fragmentation** – Cross-language services could drift without cohesive governance.

## Schema & Structural Integrity Checks
- `tasks.yml` conforms to its JSON schema.
- Governance files specify policy creation and validation steps.
- Repository layout matches architecture documentation.

## Recommendations for Realignment
1. **Update Success Criteria** – Revise README to reflect multi-commit workflow.
2. **Reduce Task Backlog Entropy** – Archive or reprioritize long-pending tasks.
3. **Clarify Cross-Language Strategy** – Provide a roadmap for Node and Rust components.
4. **Automate Policy Refresh** – Ensure Ethical Sentinel policies are dynamically loaded.
5. **Document Evolution Loop Outcomes** – Summarize results from RL and evolutionary components regularly.

## Scores
- **Narrative Intelligence Score:** 76/100
- **Agentic Harmony Score:** 72/100

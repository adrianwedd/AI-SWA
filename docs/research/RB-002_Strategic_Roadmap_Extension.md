# Research Brief RB-002: Strategic Roadmap Extension

This brief summarizes advanced research directions for AI-SWA.

## Proposed Research Tasks

1. **Vision Engine Prioritization** - Investigate heuristic and reinforcement learning approaches for ranking future epics.
2. **Cross-Language Architecture** - Explore integrating Rust for performance tasks and Node.js for I/O bound services via a microservice design.
3. **Metrics & Observability Blueprint** - Define an OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana stack to feed data back into the Reflector.
4. **Plugin Ecosystem Governance** - Design an automated CI/CD pipeline for plugin security, compliance and signing.
5. **Ethical Sentinel Policy Catalog** - Map industry AI ethics frameworks to concrete policies enforced by the Sentinel.
6. **Self-Improvement Loop Optimization** - Prototype reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies for the Reflector's learning loop.
7. **Community & Ecosystem Mapping** - Survey open-source agent frameworks and commercial platforms to position AI-SWA as a meta-platform.

These tasks extend the vision outlined in the repository manifesto and roadmap. They provide the foundation for a new research epic in `tasks.yml`.

# Governance Board

This document outlines the structure and operating procedures of the SelfArchitectAI governance board.

## Board Roles
- **Chair** – Facilitates meetings and ensures agenda items are addressed.
- **Secretary** – Records minutes and tracks action items.
- **Maintainer Representatives** – Speak on behalf of active maintainers.
- **Community Representatives** – Bring feedback from contributors and users.

## Meeting Cadence
The board meets bi‑weekly via video conference. Agendas are published at least 48 hours in advance. Minutes are posted to the repository within one week after each meeting.

## Decision Making
Decisions are made by consensus whenever possible. When consensus cannot be reached, a simple majority vote of attending members decides the outcome. Quorum is defined as half of all active board members.

Agenda proposals should be filed using the [agenda item issue template](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agenda-item.yml).

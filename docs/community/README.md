# SelfArchitectAI Community Guide

This document outlines how developers can participate in the SelfArchitectAI project.

## Join the Discussion

- Submit issues and feature requests on GitHub.
- Chat with maintainers in the project Discord server (invite coming soon).

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Follow the coding standards described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Open a pull request; the team will review and merge when ready.

## Community Health Metrics

SelfArchitectAI tracks CHAOSS metrics such as Time to First Response and Contributor Absence Factor. These metrics are displayed on the community dashboard to ensure a welcoming environment.

## Growing Authority

As the reinforcement learning systems demonstrate reliable performance improvements, project maintainers may gradually increase the RL agent's authority in automating tasks. Major changes will always be announced and open for community feedback before deployment.

## Early Adopter Program

Developers interested in shaping AI-SWA can join the [early adopter outreach program](early_adopter_program.md). This initiative coordinates Reddit and newsletter outreach and provides a direct feedback channel for early users.

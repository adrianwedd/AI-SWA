# Early Adopter Outreach Program

This document outlines how AI-SWA will engage with early adopters and gather actionable feedback.

## Goals
- Build a small but active group of developers who test AI-SWA in real projects.
- Collect feedback on usability, documentation gaps, and desired features.
- Grow initial awareness within key developer communities.

## Outreach Channels
- **Reddit**: Participate in discussions in r/LLMDevs, r/AIAGENTSNEWS, and related subreddits.
- **dev.to**: Publish technical articles introducing AI-SWA and showcasing example workflows.
- **Newsletters**: Pitch short tutorials or project updates to "Ben's Bites" and "AlphaSignal" once the 1.0 release is near.

## Getting Involved
1. Star the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adrianwedd/AI-SWA) and open an issue with the `early-adopter` label.
2. Join our Discord server (invite posted in the repository README) to chat with maintainers.
3. Share your use cases and feature requests so we can prioritize improvements.

## Feedback Loop
Early adopters are encouraged to file issues or pull requests describing their experience. The team reviews this feedback during weekly planning sessions and updates the roadmap accordingly.

# CI Audit for Task 135: Automated Plugin Certification Pipeline

Task 135 (SEC-001) aims to integrate automated security checks and signing into the CI pipeline. We inspected `.github/workflows/ci.yml` after the task implementation.

## Findings

Current CI steps include dependency installation, Docker builds, linting with `pylint`, and running unit tests:

```yaml
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: '3.12'
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt
          - name: Build Docker images
            run: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build
          - name: Install pylint
            run: pip install pylint==3.3.7
          - name: Run pylint
            run: |
              pylint --exit-zero core tests
          - name: Run tests
            run: |
              pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
```

However, there are **no stages** for:

- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Sandboxed dynamic testing of plugins
- Automatic signing of vetted plugins

## Conclusion

The pipeline does not yet implement the full certification process. Implementing SCA, SAST, sandbox tests, and signing stages is still outstanding.

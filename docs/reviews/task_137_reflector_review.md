# Task 137 Reflector Metrics Integration Review

Task 137 implemented real system health and trend analysis in the Reflector. The component now reads metrics from `metrics.json` via `MetricsProvider`. System health reports actual test coverage, dependency status, and documentation metrics. Evolution trends are derived from historical complexity and task data.

Running a reflection cycle with sample metrics produced process improvement suggestions when coverage was low and flagged outdated dependencies as architectural issues. These decisions confirm that observability metrics now influence the Reflector's output.

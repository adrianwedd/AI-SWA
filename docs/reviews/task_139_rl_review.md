# Task 139 RL Prioritization Review

The Vision Engine includes a reinforcement-learning agent used to refine WSJF task rankings.

## Findings

- `tests/test_rl_vs_wsjf_integration.py` demonstrates that an RL agent with full authority can change the ordering produced by WSJF alone.
- `tests/test_rl_training.py` validates that training metrics are collected and persisted for offline analysis.
- Details of the experiment are documented in `docs/research/RL_vs_WSJF_Test_Report.md`.

## Gaps

- No integration test covers mixed-authority modes where RL suggestions only partially override WSJF.
- The RL agent's `update_authority` logic lacks direct test coverage.

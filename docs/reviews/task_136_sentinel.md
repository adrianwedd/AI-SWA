# Task 136 Sentinel Integration Review

Verify that the Ethical Sentinel loads policy files and blocks tasks that match
listed `blocked_actions`.

- Run the orchestrator with a policy that lists a known task ID.
- Ensure the task is skipped and a log entry indicates the block.

## Review Results

- Policy file `policy_test.json` blocked task `block` as expected.
- Orchestrator logged "Action 'block' blocked by policy." to `audit_test.log`.
- Executor was not invoked.

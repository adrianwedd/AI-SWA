# Task 138 Broker Queue Review

We inspected the integration tests covering the microservice workflow for the broker and worker components.

## Findings

- `tests/test_worker_broker_flow.py` starts a broker process and verifies a worker posts results back via `/tasks/{id}/result`.
- `tests/test_worker_concurrency.py` launches multiple workers and confirms each task fetched from `/tasks/next` is processed exactly once.
- `tests/test_worker_async_loop.py` checks the worker's async loop with configurable concurrency.
- `tests/test_docker_compose_workflow.py` and `tests/e2e/test_compose_pipeline.py` run the full Docker Compose stack and execute a sample task end to end.

## Gaps

- No tests exercise the `api_gateway` service or `orchestrator_api` start/stop endpoints.
- The Node `io-service` is only pinged for health but lacks dedicated tests.
- Compose tests cover a single task and do not stress queue ordering or failure recovery.

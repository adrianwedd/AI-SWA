# Task 134 RL Agent Integration Audit

Task 134 introduced an RL-driven refinement layer for the Vision Engine. We reviewed the implementation to ensure shadow logging, training data persistence and authority updates all behave correctly.

## Findings

- `RLAgent.record_shadow_result` writes JSON lines to the specified history path. Unit tests confirm a file is created when running in shadow mode.
- `train()` now accepts metrics and appends them to in-memory `training_data`. When `training_path` is provided, metrics are also persisted to disk for offline analysis.
- `update_authority()` increases authority only when performance gains exceed a threshold; tests validate this behaviour.

Overall the RL agent integrates cleanly with `VisionEngine` and persists both history and training metrics as intended.

# Governance

SelfArchitectAI follows the **Liberal Contribution** model. Maintainers guide the project's direction while welcoming community input.

## Maintainers
- Responsible for reviewing contributions and ensuring project health.
- New maintainers are nominated by the existing team and accepted by lazy consensus.

## Decision Making
- Day‑to‑day decisions happen via pull requests and issues.
- Major changes require consensus among maintainers after public discussion.

## Feedback Channels
- GitHub Issues and Discussions for questions or proposals.
- Regular community calls announced in the repository.

## Code of Conduct
All participants are expected to behave respectfully. Violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the community.

# Research Brief RB-009: Community and Ecosystem Mapping

Understanding the broader ecosystem helps position AI-SWA in the open-source world and identify collaborators.

## Literature Summary
- **Open-source ecosystem studies** highlight the role of contributor networks in project success.
- **Commercial platform surveys** (e.g., Hugging Face, GitHub Copilot) show trends in hosted agent services.
- **Community mapping tools** like CHAOSS metrics evaluate project health and engagement.

## Open Questions
- Which adjacent projects could merge or integrate with AI-SWA?
- How can we attract contributors while maintaining clear governance?
- What outreach channels best reach developer communities interested in autonomous agents?

## Implementation Acceptance Criteria
- Produce a living ecosystem map listing strategic projects and communities.
- Track engagement metrics using CHAOSS or similar frameworks.
- Document contribution guidelines that align with governance research.

# Research Brief RB-007: Ethical Sentinel Policies

This outline surveys ethical frameworks relevant to autonomous agents and how they inform the Ethical Sentinel.

## Literature Summary
- **IEEE Ethically Aligned Design** offers guidelines for transparency and human well-being.
- **EU AI Act and OECD principles** outline requirements for accountability and risk management.
- **AI alignment research** highlights pitfalls of goal misspecification and unintended behavior.

## Open Questions
- How can policy checks be automated without overblocking legitimate experimentation?
- What escalation paths exist when the Sentinel identifies potential harm?
- How do we balance user privacy with observability requirements?

## Implementation Acceptance Criteria
- Sentinel modules should reference a documented policy catalog derived from this research.
- Policy checks need unit tests covering allowed and disallowed behaviors.
- Alerting and override mechanisms should be documented for human review.

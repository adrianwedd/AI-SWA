# Research Brief RB-006: Plugin Governance

Governance ensures plugins remain secure and compatible. This outline reviews governance models and compliance tools.

## Literature Summary
- **Open-source package governance** practices emphasize signed releases and community vetting.
- **Supply chain security frameworks** like SLSA outline provenance requirements for build pipelines.
- **Marketplace policy** examples from browser extension stores show how automated scans and manual review coexist.

## Open Questions
- What minimal review process keeps plugins safe without slowing innovation?
- How should we manage version compatibility and deprecation across plugins?
- Could a reputation system incentivize high-quality contributions?

## Implementation Acceptance Criteria
- CI must run static analysis and vulnerability scans on all plugin submissions.
- Signed artifacts should be stored alongside plugin metadata.
- Governance documentation should describe review steps and escalation paths.

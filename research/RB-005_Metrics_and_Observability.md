# Research Brief RB-005: Metrics and Observability

Capturing rich telemetry is essential for self-evolution. This outline consolidates best practices for metrics and traces.

## Literature Summary
- **OpenTelemetry** defines a vendor-neutral standard for metrics, logs, and traces.
- **Prometheus and Grafana** provide storage and visualization widely used in cloud-native setups.
- **Adaptive monitoring** approaches stream metrics back to reinforcement learning agents for continuous tuning.

## Open Questions
- Which metrics truly correlate with developer productivity and code health?
- How can we minimize overhead while capturing fine-grained traces?
- Can observability data directly influence planning decisions via the Reflector Core?

## Implementation Acceptance Criteria
- Instrument core components using OpenTelemetry APIs.
- Store metrics in Prometheus and expose Grafana dashboards as code.
- Prove feedback into the Reflector by feeding metrics to learning algorithms.

# Tasklog: Update tasks

## Reasoning
The drift analysis report recommended several alignment tasks not yet in `tasks.yml`.
We reviewed the pending backlog and identified missing automation steps and documentation gaps.

## Plan
- Append ten new tasks with IDs 225-234 covering architecture drift detection, backlog hygiene, and cross-language clarity.
- Maintain schema compliance with `tasks.yml`.

## Expected Output
- Updated `tasks.yml` with 10 new tasks.

## Additional Tasks
- Marked task 139 as done based on `docs/research/RL_vs_WSJF_Test_Report.md`.
- Added tasks 235-244 derived from completed research reports, covering SelfAuditor tooling, developer knowledge mapping, RL-based compiler optimization, and Ethical Sentinel enhancements.
